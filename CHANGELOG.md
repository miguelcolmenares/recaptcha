## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-28

### Added

- `RecaptchaField` and `useRecaptcha` (`/client`): hidden-input token field with refresh, lazy loading, and stable handling of callback props.
- `verifyRecaptcha`, `getRecaptchaToken`, `isRecaptchaEnabled` (`/server`): server-side check of score, action and hostname that returns a typed result.
- A documentation site built with [docs-sitekit](https://github.com/miguelcolmenares/docs-sitekit): getting started, guides, API reference and examples, published to GitHub Pages by `publish.yml` after each release and by `docs.yml` on changes to `main`.
- Root entry with constants, types and the pure `evaluateResponse` rule, free of React.
- Pack-and-install verification (`npm run verify:package`): checks the tarball, runs the installed package in plain Node as ESM and CommonJS, builds a Next.js app with it and resolves types under `node10`, `node16` and `bundler`.
- Playwright end-to-end tests, including client-side navigation, back and forward, and lazy loading, against a stubbed script and against real Google.
