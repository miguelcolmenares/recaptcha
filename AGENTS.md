# AGENTS.md

Context for any AI agent working in this repository.

## What this is

`recaptcha-next`: reCAPTCHA v3 for React and Next.js, MIT. Written from scratch.
Do not add code, text or configuration copied from other projects, and do not add dependencies on private packages.

## Layout (Domain-Driven Design, barrel exports)

```text
src/
  domain/          pure rules, constants, types. No I/O, no React.
  application/     use cases and ports (interfaces). Depends on domain only.
  infrastructure/  adapters: Google HTTP gateway, browser script loader. Implements ports.
  presentation/    React: the field component and the hook.
  index.ts         root entry: values and types, no React
  client.ts        "use client" entry
  server.ts        server entry, where adapters are wired to use cases
  __tests__/       unit tests, and __tests__/integration for tests with real HTTP
e2e/
  fixture/app/     Next.js app used to consume the packed tarball
  specs/           Playwright specs
scripts/           verify-package.mjs, the pack-and-install check
```

Rules: dependencies point inward (presentation and infrastructure may import application and domain, never the
reverse). Every layer has an `index.ts`, and other layers import it, not its files. Two exceptions, both on purpose:
`client.ts` and `server.ts` are composition roots and import files directly, and `presentation` imports
`infrastructure/scriptLoader` directly so the server-only Google gateway stays out of the browser bundle.

## Naming

- Components: `PascalCase.tsx`. Hooks: `useThing.ts`. Everything else: `camelCase.ts`.
- Tests: `src/__tests__/<unit>.test.ts(x)`. Specs: `e2e/specs/<feature>.spec.ts`.
- Types are exported with `export type`. Use `import type` for type-only imports.

## Tests

Three levels, all required for new behavior:

1. **Unit** (`npm run test:unit`): one unit, no network. jsdom only where the DOM is needed (`@jest-environment jsdom`).
2. **Integration** (`npm run test:integration`): real use case and real adapter over a local HTTP server.
3. **End-to-end** (`npm run test:e2e`): packs the tarball, installs it in `e2e/fixture`, builds it with Next.js,
   checks the build output, then runs Playwright.

Tests transpile only (`@swc/jest`). Types are checked by `npm run typecheck`, never inside the test runner.
Tests that need a real Google key skip themselves when the keys are missing.

## Rules learned the hard way

- `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*` must be a literal member expression in client code, or the bundler will not inline it.
  `verify:package` fails if it is not.
- Server code must never reach the browser bundle. `verify:package` greps the bundle.
- `peerDependencies` list only majors that the tests run. Narrow first, widen with evidence.
- Every subpath must resolve under `node10`, `node16` and `bundler`. `verify:package` checks all three.
- A dev tool must not cap TypeScript in its peer range. One exception is documented in `.github/dependabot.yml`.
- A callback prop must never restart an effect. Keep callbacks in refs.
- Loading a script is not the same as the global being ready. Wait for `grecaptcha.ready`.
- Never unload Google's script when a component unmounts. Tested with real Google: removing the tag and
  loading it again after a client-side navigation left duplicate badges and extra scripts, and sometimes a
  `window.grecaptcha` with no tag. A stubbed script hides this, so the navigation specs run against real Google too.
- Errors that Google's own frames log in the console (for example `requestStorageAccess`) are not ours. The e2e
  helper filters them by origin and by one exact message, nothing broader.
- Release with npm trusted publishing (OIDC). No long-lived tokens.
- Node support: CI runs every Node line that is not past end of life (today 22, 24 and 26), and the e2e and publish
  jobs run on the newest LTS. Node 22 ends on 2027-04-30: drop it from the matrix and from `engines` then. Node 26 became
  LTS on 2026-10-28 and ends on 2029-04-30. Trusted publishing needs npm 11.5.1 or newer, which every Node here ships.
